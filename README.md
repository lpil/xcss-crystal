# xcss Crystal

I'm continuing this project in Rust [here](https://github.com/lpil/xcss).

This was my first play with Crystal, so I'm keeping this repo for posterity.


## On Crystal and Rust

I am personally more interested in Rust as I find the ML style type system
extremely appealing, the lack of a GC opens the door to realtime programming,
something I cannot do with the languages I am currently comfortable with.
Additionally the functional influence and lack of traditional OOP make it a
little closer to the functional style I normally opt for.

On the flip side I found Crystal was remarkably easy to pick up and be
productive with, something Rust really stuggles with. I would feel more
comfortable introducing Crystal to a team with deadlines and a range of skill
levels than I would Rust.

Both languages have excellent tooling (including code formatters!) that I
thoroughly enjoyed using.

Overall I thought Crystal was quite a nice alternative to Ruby or perhaps Go,
and I'd certainly consider using it for some tasks in a profession capacity.
